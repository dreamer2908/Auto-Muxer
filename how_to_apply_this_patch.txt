Hi there! Yes, you!

In short:
- Move your original file (&basefile&) into this folder. In future, I might make the script search for it, but just do as I say for now.
- Run the applying script written for your operating system: for Windows, apply_patch_windows.bat; for Linux/Unix, apply_patch_linux.sh; for Mac OSX, apply_patch_mac.command. Mac scripts might work for Linux/Unix.
- Check if a new file is created (&patchedfile&). If it was, you're successful; stop here.
- If it isn't, try the alternative script.
- If even the alternative script fails, bug the person who gave you this patch. Do not bug me (the author of this script); it works in all my tests. If something goes wrong, it's either his/her or your own fault.

You might want to check for some system requirements:
- A *working* computer.
- A *working* and *modern* PC operating system (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OSX).
- For Mac OSX: xdelta3 package installed. I don't have a Mac so I don't have any Mac xdelta3 binary to include with this patch. Feel free to donate me one if you want it.
- For Linux/Unix: either xdelta3 package installed, WinE package installed, or included Linux binaries' permission set to executable.
- For Windows: nothing prevents the script from executing the binary file xdelta3.exe.
